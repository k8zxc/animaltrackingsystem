ABSTRACT:

The design project was conducted to develop an animal tracking system using GPS and LoRa technology. Specifically, it aimed to design and construct a circuit for the animal tracking system; assemble a gateway that receives data from the end devices; develop a program for the system; integrate a graphical user interface to the network server; test and evaluate the system; and conduct cost computation of the study.

The tracking system is composed of two main parts â€” the node and the gateway. The node is a collar tag consists of an accelerometer, microcontroller, voltage regulator, LoRa and GPS modules. The receiver of the system is a LoRaWAN gateway made up of a concentrator and Raspberry Pi. The location of the node, RSSI and SNR are displayed on Cayenne by myDevices which is directly integrated to the network server The Things Network. The current and past locations of the node are plotted on a map and the data can be downloaded.

Results of the evaluation showed that the system is functional, accurate, and long range. The location transmitted by the end node is the same with the coordinates recorded by a Smartphone. The gateway has a good sensitivity and was able to receive messages from any direction.

The study has successfully provided an animal tracking system and was proven effective on its capability to meet the objectives. The total cost of the animal tracking system is P20,070.31.
